# RomanArabicCalculator
The project is a test task for a coding school. And this is my first program in java.

Calculator can accept arabic nubers from 1 to 10 and roman numerals from I to X. 

Possible operations: "+", "-", "/", "*".

Expected input format: "1+10" or "III-II".

To try a program MyCalculatorSolution.java has to be run.
